Title: Event Triggered Execution

Description: Adversaries may establish persistence using system mechanisms that trigger execution based on specific events. Mobile operating systems have means to subscribe to events such as receiving an SMS message, device boot completion, or other device activities.

Adversaries may abuse these mechanisms as a means of maintaining persistent access to a victim via automatically and repeatedly executing malicious code. After gaining access to a victim's system, adversaries may create or modify event triggers to point to malicious content that will be executed whenever the event trigger is invoked.

ID: S1079 | Name: BOULDSPY | Source Type: software | Mapping Type: uses | Mapping

description: [BOULDSPY](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S1079) uses a background service that can restart itself when the parent activity is stopped.(Citation: lookout_bouldspy_0423) | Mitigations:

Mitigation ID: M1006 | Mitigation name: Use Recent OS Version | Description: New mobile operating system versions bring not only patches against discovered vulnerabilities but also often bring security architecture improvements that provide resilience against potential vulnerabilities or weaknesses that have not yet been discovered. They may also bring improvements that block use of observed adversary techniques. | Detection:

Application vetting services can detect which broadcast intents an application registers for and which permissions it requests.
