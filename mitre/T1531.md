Title: Account Access Removal

Description: Adversaries may interrupt availability of system and network resources by inhibiting access to accounts utilized by legitimate users. Accounts may be deleted, locked, or manipulated (ex: changed credentials) to remove access to accounts. Adversaries may also subsequently log off and/or perform a [System Shutdown/Reboot](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1529) to set malicious changes into place.(Citation: CarbonBlack LockerGoga 2019)(Citation: Unit42 LockerGoga 2019)

In Windows, [Net](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0039) utility, <code>Set-LocalUser</code> and <code>Set-ADAccountPassword</code>

[PowerShell](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1059/001) cmdlets may be used by adversaries to modify user accounts. In Linux, the <code>passwd</code> utility may be used to change passwords. Accounts could also be disabled by Group Policy.

Adversaries who use ransomware or similar attacks may first perform this and other Impact behaviors, such as [Data Destruction](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1485) and [Defacement](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1491), in order to impede incident response/recovery before completing the [Data Encrypted for Impact](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1486) objective. Metadata:

ID: T1531

Related Tactics (the tactic objectives that T1531 can be used to accomplish): Impact URL: https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1531

Platforms (the system the adversary is operating within): Linux, Office 365, SaaS, Windows, macOS Impact type: Availability

Procedure Examples (usage examples):

ID: G1004 | Name: LAPSUS$ | Source Type: group | Mapping Type: uses | Mapping description: [LAPSUS$](https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G1004) has removed a targeted organization's global admin accounts to lock the organization out of all access.(Citation: MSTIC DEV-0537 Mar 2022) |

ID: S0372 | Name: LockerGoga | Source Type: software | Mapping Type: uses | Mapping description: [LockerGoga](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0372) has been observed changing account passwords and logging off current users.(Citation: CarbonBlack LockerGoga 2019)(Citation: Unit42 LockerGoga 2019) |

ID: S0576 | Name: MegaCortex | Source Type: software | Mapping Type: uses | Mapping description: [MegaCortex](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0576) has changed user account passwords and logged users off the system.(Citation: IBM MegaCortex) |

ID: S0688 | Name: Meteor | Source Type: software | Mapping Type: uses | Mapping description: [Meteor](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0688) has the ability to change the password of local users on compromised hosts and can log off users.(Citation: Check Point Meteor Aug 2021) | Detection:

Use process monitoring to monitor the execution and command line parameters of binaries involved in deleting accounts or changing passwords, such as use of

[Net](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0039). Windows event logs may also designate activity associated with an adversary's attempt to remove access to an account:

* Event ID 4723 - An attempt was made to change an account's password

* Event ID 4724 - An attempt was made to reset an account's password

* Event ID 4726 - A user account was deleted

* Event ID 4740 - A user account was locked out

Alerting on [Net](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0039) and these Event IDs may generate a high degree of false positives, so compare against baseline knowledge for how systems are typically used and correlate modification events with other indications of malicious activity where possible.
