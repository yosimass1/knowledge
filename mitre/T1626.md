Mitigation ID: M1013 | Mitigation name: Application Developer Guidance | Description: This mitigation describes any guidance or training given to developers of applications to avoid introducing security weaknesses that an adversary may be able to take advantage of. | Detection:

When an application requests administrator permission, users are presented with a popup and the option to grant or deny the request. Application vetting services can detect when an application requests administrator permission. Extra scrutiny could be applied to applications that do
