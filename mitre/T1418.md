Title: Software Discovery

Description: Adversaries may attempt to get a listing of applications that are installed on a device. Adversaries may use the information from [Software

Discovery](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1418) during automated discovery to shape follow-on behaviors, including whether or not to fully infect the target and/or attempts specific actions.

Adversaries may attempt to enumerate applications for a variety of reasons, such as figuring out what security measures are present or to identify the presence of target applications. Metadata:

Mitigation ID: M1006 | Mitigation name: Use Recent OS Version | Description: New mobile operating system versions bring not only patches against discovered vulnerabilities but also often bring security architecture improvements that provide resilience against potential vulnerabilities or weaknesses that have not yet been discovered. They may also bring improvements that block use of observed adversary techniques. |

Mitigation ID: M1011 | Mitigation name: User Guidance | Description: Describes any guidance or training given to users to set particular configuration settings or avoid specific potentially risky behaviors. |

Detection:

Application vetting services could look for the Android permission

'android.permission.QUERY_ALL_PACKAGES', and apply extra scrutiny to applications that

request it. On iOS, application vetting services could look for usage of the private API 'LSApplicationWorkspace' and apply extra scrutiny to applications that employ it.
