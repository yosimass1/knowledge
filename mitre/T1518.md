Title: Software Discovery

Description: Adversaries may attempt to get a listing of software and software versions that are installed on a system or in a cloud environment. Adversaries may use the information from [Software Discovery](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1518) during automated discovery to shape follow-on behaviors, including whether or not the adversary fully infects the target and/or attempts specific actions.

Adversaries may attempt to enumerate software for a variety of reasons, such as figuring out what security measures are present or if the compromised system has a version of software that is vulnerable to [Exploitation for Privilege Escalation](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1068). Metadata:

ID: T1518

Related Tactics (the tactic objectives that T1518 can be used to accomplish): Discovery URL: https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1518

Platforms (the system the adversary is operating within): Azure AD, Google Workspace, IaaS, Linux, Office 365, SaaS, Windows, macOS

Permissions required (the lowest level of permission the adversary is required to be operating within to perform T1518): Administrator, User

System and network discovery techniques normally occur throughout an operation as an adversary

learns the environment. Data and events should not be viewed in isolation, but as part of a chain of behavior that could lead to other activities, such as lateral movement, based on the information obtained.

Monitor processes and command-line arguments for actions that could be taken to gather system and network information. Remote access tools with built-in features may interact directly with the Windows API to gather information. Information may also be acquired through Windows system management tools such as [Windows Management

Instrumentation](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1047) and

[PowerShell](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1059/001).
