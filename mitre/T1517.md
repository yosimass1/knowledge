Title: Access Notifications

Description: Adversaries may collect data within notifications sent by the operating system or other applications. Notifications may contain sensitive data such as one-time authentication codes sent over SMS, email, or other mediums. In the case of Credential Access, adversaries may attempt to intercept one-time code sent to the device. Adversaries can also dismiss notifications to prevent the user from noticing that the notification has arrived and can trigger action buttons contained within notifications.(Citation: ESET 2FA Bypass)

Mitigations:

Mitigation ID: M1013 | Mitigation name: Application Developer Guidance | Description: This

mitigation describes any guidance or training given to developers of applications to avoid introducing security weaknesses that an adversary may be able to take advantage of. | Mitigation ID: M1012 | Mitigation name: Enterprise Policy | Description: An enterprise mobility management (EMM), also known as mobile device management (MDM), system can be used to provision policies to mobile devices to control aspects of their allowed behavior. | Mitigation ID: M1011 | Mitigation name: User Guidance | Description: Describes any guidance or training given to users to set particular configuration settings or avoid specific potentially risky behaviors. |

Detection:

Application vetting services can look for applications requesting the

'BIND_NOTIFICATION_LISTENER_SERVICE' permission in a service declaration. Users can also inspect and modify the list of applications that have notification access through the device settings (e.g. Apps & notification -> Special app access -> Notification access).
