Title: Input Injection

Description: A malicious application can inject input to the user interface to mimic user interaction through the abuse of Android's accessibility APIs.

[Input Injection](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1516) can be achieved using any of the following methods:

* Mimicking user clicks on the screen, for example to steal money from a user's PayPal account.(Citation: android-trojan-steals-paypal-2fa)

* Injecting global actions, such as 'GLOBAL_ACTION_BACK' (programatically mimicking a physical back button press), to trigger actions on behalf of the user.(Citation: Talos Gustuff Apr 2019)

* Inserting input into text fields on behalf of the user. This method is used legitimately to auto-fill text fields by applications such as password managers.(Citation: bitwarden autofill logins) Metadata:
