Title: Remote Access Software

Description: Adversaries may use legitimate remote access software, such as 'VNC',

'TeamViewer', 'AirDroid', 'AirMirror', etc., to establish an interactive command and control channel to target mobile devices.

Remote access applications may be installed and used post-compromise as an alternate communication channel for redundant access or as a way to establish an interactive remote session with the target device. They may also be used as a component of malware to establish a reverse connection to an adversary-controlled system or service. Installation of remote access tools may also include persistence.
