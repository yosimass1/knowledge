Title: Device Driver Discovery

Description: Adversaries may attempt to enumerate local device drivers on a victim host.

Information about device drivers may highlight various insights that shape follow-on behaviors, such as the function/purpose of the host, present security tools (i.e. [Security Software

Discovery](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1518/001)) or other defenses (e.g.,

[Virtualization/Sandbox Evasion](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1497)), as well as potential exploitable vulnerabilities (e.g., [Exploitation for Privilege

Escalation](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1068)).

Many OS utilities may provide information about local device drivers, such as 'driverquery.exe' and the 'EnumDeviceDrivers()' API function on Windows.(Citation: Microsoft Driverquery)(Citation: Microsoft EnumDeviceDrivers) Information about device drivers (as well as associated services, i.e., [System Service Discovery](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1007)) may also be available in the Registry.(Citation: Microsoft Registry Drivers)

On Linux/macOS, device drivers (in the form of kernel modules) may be visible within '/dev' or using utilities such as 'lsmod' and 'modinfo'.(Citation: Linux Kernel Programming)(Citation: lsmod man)(Citation: modinfo man)
