Title: Audio Capture

Description: Adversaries may capture audio to collect information by leveraging standard operating system APIs of a mobile device. Examples of audio information adversaries may target include user conversations, surroundings, phone calls, or other sensitive information. Android and iOS, by default, require that applications request device microphone access from the user.

On Android devices, applications must hold the 'RECORD_AUDIO' permission to access the microphone or the 'CAPTURE_AUDIO_OUTPUT' permission to access audio output. Because Android does not allow third-party applications to hold the 'CAPTURE_AUDIO_OUTPUT' permission by default, only privileged applications, such as those distributed by Google or the device vendor, can access audio output.(Citation: Android Permissions) However, adversaries may be able to gain this access after successfully elevating their privileges. With the

'CAPTURE_AUDIO_OUTPUT' permission, adversaries may pass the

'MediaRecorder.AudioSource.VOICE_CALL' constant to 'MediaRecorder.setAudioOutput', allowing capture of both voice call uplink and downlink.(Citation: Manifest.permission)

On iOS devices, applications must include the 'NSMicrophoneUsageDescription' key in their 'Info.plist' file to access the microphone.(Citation: Requesting Auth-Media Capture) Metadata:

Mitigation ID: M1006 | Mitigation name: Use Recent OS Version | Description: New mobile operating system versions bring not only patches against discovered vulnerabilities but also often bring

security architecture improvements that provide resilience against potential vulnerabilities or weaknesses that have not yet been discovered. They may also bring improvements that block use of observed adversary techniques. |

Mitigation ID: M1011 | Mitigation name: User Guidance | Description: Describes any guidance or training given to users to set particular configuration settings or avoid specific potentially risky behaviors. |

## Detection:

In iOS 14 and up, an orange dot (or orange square if the Differentiate Without Color setting is enabled) appears in the status bar when the microphone is being used by an application. However, there have been demonstrations indicating it may still be possible to access the microphone in the background without triggering this visual indicator by abusing features that natively access the microphone or camera but do not trigger the visual indicators.(Citation: iOS Mic Spyware) In Android 12 and up, a green dot appears in the status bar when the microphone is being used by an application.(Citation: Android Privacy Indicators)

Android applications using the 'RECORD_AUDIO' permission and iOS applications using 'RequestRecordPermission' should be carefully reviewed and monitored. If the

'CAPTURE_AUDIO_OUTPUT' permission is found in a third-party Android application, the application should be heavily scrutinized.

In both Android (6.0 and up) and iOS, users can review which applications have the permission to access the microphone through the device settings screen and revoke permissions as necessary.
