Title: Download New Code at Runtime

Description: Adversaries may download and execute dynamic code not included in the original application package after installation. This technique is primarily used to evade static analysis checks and pre-publication scans in official app stores. In some cases, more advanced dynamic or behavioral analysis techniques could detect this behavior. However, in conjunction with [Execution Guardrails](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1627) techniques, detecting malicious code downloaded after installation could be difficult.

On Android, dynamic code could include native code, Dalvik code, or JavaScript code that utilizes Android WebView's 'JavascriptInterface' capability.

On iOS, dynamic code could be downloaded and executed through 3rd party libraries such as JSPatch. (Citation: FireEye-JSPatch)

Mitigation ID: M1006 | Mitigation name: Use Recent OS Version | Description: New mobile operating system versions bring not only patches against discovered vulnerabilities but also often bring security architecture improvements that provide resilience against potential vulnerabilities or weaknesses that have not yet been discovered. They may also bring improvements that block use of observed adversary techniques. | Detection:

Existing network infrastructure may detect network calls to known malicious domains or the transfer of malicious payloads over the network. Mobile security products may provide URL inspection services that could determine if a domain being visited is malicious. Application vetting services could look for indications that the application downloads and executes new code at runtime (e.g., on Android, use of 'DexClassLoader', 'System.load', or the WebView 'JavaScriptInterface' capability; on iOS, use of JSPatch or similar capabilities). Unfortunately, this is only a partial mitigation, as additional scrutiny would still need to be applied to applications that use these techniques. These techniques are often used without malicious intent, and applications may employ other techniques to hide their use of these techniques.
