Title: Endpoint Denial of Service

Description: Adversaries may perform Endpoint Denial of Service (DoS) attacks to degrade or block the availability of services to users.

On Android versions prior to 7, apps can abuse Device Administrator access to reset the device lock passcode, preventing the user from unlocking the device. After Android 7, only device or profile owners (e.g. MDMs) can reset the device's passcode.(Citation: Android resetPassword) On iOS devices, this technique does not work because mobile device management servers can only remove the screen lock passcode; they cannot set a new passcode. However, on jailbroken devices, malware has been discovered that can lock the user out of the device.(Citation:

ID: S0323 | Name: Charger | Source Type: software | Mapping Type: uses | Mapping description: [Charger](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0323) locks the device if it is granted admin permissions, displaying a message demanding a ransom payment.(Citation: CheckPoint-Charger) |

ID: S0522 | Name: Exobot | Source Type: software | Mapping Type: uses | Mapping description: [Exobot](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0522) can lock the device with a password and permanently disable the screen.(Citation: Threat Fabric Exobot) |

ID: S0536 | Name: GPlayed | Source Type: software | Mapping Type: uses | Mapping description: [GPlayed](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0536) can lock the user out of the device by showing a persistent overlay.(Citation: Talos GPlayed) |

ID: S0298 | Name: Xbot | Source Type: software | Mapping Type: uses | Mapping description: [Xbot](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0298) can remotely lock infected Android devices and ask for a ransom.(Citation: PaloAlto-Xbot) | Mitigations:

Mitigation ID: M1006 | Mitigation name: Use Recent OS Version | Description: New mobile operating system versions bring not only patches against discovered vulnerabilities but also often bring security architecture improvements that provide resilience against potential vulnerabilities or weaknesses that have not yet been discovered. They may also bring improvements that block use of observed adversary techniques. |

Mitigation ID: M1011 | Mitigation name: User Guidance | Description: Describes any guidance or training given to users to set particular configuration settings or avoid specific potentially risky behaviors. |

Detection:

On Android, users can review which applications have Device Administrator access in the device settings and revoke permission where appropriate. Application vetting services can detect and closely scrutinize applications that utilize Device Administrator access.
