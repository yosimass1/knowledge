Title: System Network Configuration Discovery

Description: Adversaries may look for details about the network configuration and settings, such as IP and/or MAC addresses, of operating systems they access or through information discovery of remote systems.

On Android, details of onboard network interfaces are accessible to apps through the 'java.net.NetworkInterface' class.(Citation: NetworkInterface) Previously, the Android 'TelephonyManager' class could be used to gather telephony-related device identifiers, information such as the IMSI, IMEI, and phone number. However, starting with Android 10, only preloaded, carrier, the default SMS, or device and profile owner applications can access the telephony-related device identifiers.(Citation: TelephonyManager)

On iOS, gathering network configuration information is not possible without root access. Adversaries may use the information from [System Network Configuration

Discovery](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1422) during automated discovery to shape follow-on behaviors, including determining certain access within the target network and what actions to do next.

Mitigation ID: M1006 | Mitigation name: Use Recent OS Version | Description: New mobile operating system versions bring not only patches against discovered vulnerabilities but also often bring security architecture improvements that provide resilience against potential vulnerabilities or weaknesses that have not yet been discovered. They may also bring improvements that block use of observed adversary techniques. | Detection:

Application vetting services could look for usage of the 'READ_PRIVILEGED_PHONE_STATE' Android permission. This could indicate that non-system apps are attempting to access information

that they do not have access to.
